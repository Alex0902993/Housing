We will now be working on this branch, simply work as usual, but when pushing, make sure to push to the rmd branch:

Before moving forward now is the right moment to actually discuss why you would want to convert the script into Rmds. There are several reasons. First, as argued in the chapter on literate programming, a document that mixes prose and code is easier to read and share than a script. Next, since this Rmd file can get knitted into any type of document (PDF, Word, etc…), it also makes it easier to arrive at what interests us, the output. A script is simply a means, it’s not an end. The end is (in most cases) a document so we might as well use literate programming to avoid the cursed loop of changing the script, editing the document, going back to the script, etc.
